Data Scientist focused on statistical modeling, machine learning, and data-driven applications.

## Core Skills

- Data Analysis: Python, data visualization.
- Statistical modeling, Machine learning, Deep learning, Bayesian methods.
- NLP and Generative AI
- Production grade development: Cloud environment, best practices like CI/CD, unit tests, git versioning, etc.

## Featured Projects

- NBA Analytics Suite: Statistical analysis platform for player and team performance ([example](https://pdgarden.github.io/nba-stats-eda/eda_nba_players_accuracy_evolution.html)). Data extracted from local datawarehouse based on DBT / DuckDB ([repo](https://github.com/pdgarden/nba-stats)). An engine was implemented to convert questions in natural language to SQL queries that are executed on the datawarehouse by leveraging LLMs ([repo](https://github.com/pdgarden/nba-insights-engine)). 
- Recipe Recommendation Engine: ML-based personalized recipe suggestion system ([repo](https://github.com/pdgarden/recipe-recommender-system)) leveraging LLM, sentence embedding, similarity search and KNN (see [approach](https://pdgarden.github.io/recipe-recommender-system/eda/eda_recipe_recommendations.html)).
